## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
root = [2,1,3]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[2,3,1]
```

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
root = []
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
