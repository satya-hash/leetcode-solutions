## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
true
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
false
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
