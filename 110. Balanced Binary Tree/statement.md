# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

---

## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
    3
   / \
  9  20
     / \
    15  7
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
true
```

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
      1
     / \
    2   2
   / \
  3   3
 / \
4   4
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
false
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
