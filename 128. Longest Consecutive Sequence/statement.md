# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

---

## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
4
```

**Explanation:** The longest consecutive sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
9
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
