---

## Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
n = 2
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
2
```

**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top:

1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
n = 3
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top:

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
