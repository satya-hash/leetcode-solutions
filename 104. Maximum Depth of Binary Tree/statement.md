# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

---

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
3
```

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
root = [1,null,2]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
2
```

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
root = []
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
0
```

---

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

---

## Follow-up

Can you solve this problem both recursively and iteratively?
